Ceramic is a decentralized data network, that allows for building composable Web3 applications. Since Ceramic decentralizes application databases, application developers can reuse data across applications and make them automatically interoperable.

Ceramic is building:

A generalized data protocol
where data can be modified only by the owner
with high volume data processing
with global data availability and consistency
with support for fast querying
with interoperable data across applications
and community governance
